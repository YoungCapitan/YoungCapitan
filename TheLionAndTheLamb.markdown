![Lion](/lion.jpg)

"The lamb with the lion" – often a paraphrase from Isaiah, and more closely quoted as "the lion and lamb", "a child will lead them", and the like – are an artistic and symbolic device, most generally related to peace.
The symbol is used in both Christianity and Judaism to represent the Messianic Age.
